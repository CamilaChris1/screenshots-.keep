# Quiz Builder – Starter Template

This project is a starter template for building quizzes using Base44.

It is not a finished quiz product.  
Sample questions and structures are included as placeholders and are meant to be replaced with custom content.

This repository is used for personal organisation, learning, and version tracking.  
The live app is managed inside Base44.
